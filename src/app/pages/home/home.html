          Recipick flips the logic of cooking on its head. Instead of searching for a recipe and
          then shopping for ingredients, look at what you have on hand and create a recipe. It's a
          real solution for saving money and reducing food waste at home.
        </app-paragraph>
        <app-paragraph title="The Smart 'Pick' Precision">
          Our "Pick" feature is powered by context-aware AI. If a user only has "Eggs and Soy
          Sauce," Recipick won't suggest "Fried Rice" (because the user doesn't have rice), but
          instead will suggest "Pontianak Fried Egg" which specifically uses those ingredients.
        </app-paragraph>
        <app-paragraph title="Digital Intelligence, Soulful Experience">
          With a design inspired by a physical recipe book and a fun font, users will feel like
          they're consulting with a friendly "Cooking Friend" or "Kitchen Assistant." This app is
          designed to relieve stress when you're unsure what to cook.
        </app-paragraph>
        <app-paragraph title="Instant Culinary Inspiration">
          Because it's based on Generative AI, Recipick's recipes are limitless. Users can enjoy a
          unique Indonesian menu every day, providing an element of surprise every time they press
          the "Pick!" button.
